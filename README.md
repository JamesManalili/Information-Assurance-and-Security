# Information Assurance & Security â€“ Cisco Packet Tracer Lab Compilation

These hands-on activities were completed as part of my coursework to build, configure, and secure network topologies using Cisco Packet Tracer.

Each .pkt file in this repository represents a key networking or security concept applied in a real-world scenario using simulation tools. These activities reinforce network security fundamentals, firewall configuration, IP planning, and packet tracing skills â€” essential for roles in cybersecurity and IT infrastructure.
